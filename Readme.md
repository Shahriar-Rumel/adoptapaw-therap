AdoptAPaw is a web app developed for animal welfare. In our country, the mistreatment of animals, specifically domestic or stray animals is widely seen.Animals are caged, sold, and transferred to dangerous places for commercial purposes. People are taking animals from the streets and then caging them to sell them for their benefit. Often animals living on the streets meet with horrifying car accidents. Some emotionally deranged people beat up animals which often results in them losing their eyesight or moving ability.

Under these circumstances, a central online platform like adoptapaw can work as a blessing for adopting stray animals who are in dire need of a loving home.Adoptapaw helps user to find pet quickly and our review process ensures that the user can get authentic information while adopting.Adoptapaw also provides a central hub for users to post about theirs missing pets and offer rewards for information regarding their pet.
