Adoptapaw is a web-based online platform that allows users to find animals for adoption, help them find their missing pets, and raise funds to help vulnerable animals through donations from users.

Adoptapaw was initiated from the belief that animals are not products that people should be making a profit by selling and buying them. So, Adoptapaw offers people to find a companion through adoption without any monetary transactions.
