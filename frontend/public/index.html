      content="AdoptAPaw is a web  project developed for animal welfare. In our country the mistreatment of animals, specifically domestic or stray animals are widely seen. Animal abuse in our country is increasing at an alarming rate. Animals are caged, sold and transferred to dangerous places for commercial purposes. People are taking animals from streets and then caging them to sell them for their own benefit. Often animals living on streets meet with horrifying car accidents. Some emotionally deranged people beat up animals which often results in them losing their eyesight or moving ability. 
      Under these circumstances, a central online platform can work as a blessing for adopting stray animals who are in dire need of a loving home. Adopting an animal can also help people overcome their loneliness. There is a need for a system to quickly make an announcement about an animal who is in a vulnerable condition or is being mistreated so that people nearby can come for help. Moreover, many organizations work for animals but lack a central donation platform through which they can help sick or wounded animals.In an effort to stop the mistreatment and to rehabilitate sick animals our application can be used comprehensively. The donations that can be received from our application can provide helpless animals to start a new life.
